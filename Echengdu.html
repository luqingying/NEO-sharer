In June 2008, the Kuan Alley and Zhai Alley renovation project, which lasted for three years, was completed. The renovation of the Kuan Alley and Zhai Alley is composed of 45 architectural communities, such as the courtyard house of the late Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the people's style, the garden building with the cultural and cultural background, the newly built house style The Inn Boutique and so on.

        <p>The wide lane and narrow alley are the epitome of the ancient and young city of Chengdu, a symbol of deep memory. When tourists are accompanying the sunset, watching the smoke of the kitchen and walking in the alley of the dusk, a scene that is long gone from the old city to the citizenry life is floating in front of us.</p>
