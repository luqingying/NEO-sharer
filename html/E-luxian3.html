        <p><h3>go back and forth, the soul of the poem forever - Taibai forest of steles</h3>
        It is said that Li Bai grabbed a Book of Songs when he was one year old. His father was very happy that his son might become a famous poet when he grew up. He wanted to give Li Baiqu a good name. Because he was careful in naming his son, the more careful he was, the more he could not remember it. Until his son was seven years old, he didn't think of a suitable name. That spring, Li Bai's father said to his wife and child, "I want to write a spring day sentence, only to write two sentences. You mother and son add one sentence to me. One word is "spring breeze sends warm flowers to bloom". Mother thought for a while and said, "the apricot forest is red and the sun is falling. "</p>
        <p>Li Bai waited for his mother to speak, and without thinking, he pointed to Li Shuyi, who was blooming in the courtyard, and blurted out, "Li Hua bloomed with a white tree. My father applauded when he heard it, and indeed his son had poetry. The more he read his heart, the more he liked to read. He suddenly thought that the first word of the poem was not his family name. This last white character is very well used. It is saying that a plum tree is as holy as snow. In that case, he named his son Li Bai</p>
